                The Oosterpark (English: Eastern Park) is the first large park laid out by the municipality of Amsterdam. 
                Located near the Singelgracht to the north, it is the principal component of the Oosterpark neighbourhood in the Oost borough. 
                The park, an English garden, was designed by Dutch landscape architect Leonard Anthony Springer and completed in 1891.

                The park contains the National Slavery Monument, which commemorates the abolition of slavery in the Netherlands in 1863. 
                The monument was unveiled on 1 July 2002 in the presence of Her Majesty Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands.
